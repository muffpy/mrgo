mrgo is a fault tolerant MapReduce system built in Go and based on the classic [MapReduce](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf) paper. We have several worker processes that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a single coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers. The workers will talk to the coordinator via RPC.
